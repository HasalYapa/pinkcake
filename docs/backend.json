    "reasoning": "This Firestore structure is designed to support the CakesLK application, focusing on security, scalability, and ease of debugging. It adheres to the principle of Authorization Independence by avoiding hierarchical `get()` calls in security rules, relying instead on denormalization of authorization data where needed. The structure also facilitates secure list operations by segregating data based on access requirements.\n\n**Authorization Independence:** The design emphasizes authorization independence. The most crucial aspect of this design is how roles are handled. The database uses explicit collections for admin roles (`/roles_admin/{uid}`). This enables authorization rules based solely on the existence of a document, eliminating the need for `get()` calls to parent documents. The ownership for the `orders` collection can be managed either by restricting write access to admins only, or by associating the order with a `userId` if customers were given accounts in the system, in which case read access to a particular order would be granted to the `userId` associated to the order.\n\n**Structural Segregation:** The `/orders` collection segregates all order data, ensuring consistent security posture across all order documents. The `/orderStatuses` collection is separated from orders to hold possible status values for orders. The `/users` collection stores the admin user's data for the backend.\n\n**Access Modeling:** We utilize Path-Based Ownership for admin user data stored in the `/users/{userId}` collection. Global admin roles are modeled using the existence of documents in the `/roles_admin/{uid}` collection.\n\n**QAPs (Rules are not Filters):** The design supports secure `list` operations. Access to the `/orders` collection is restricted to authenticated admins only, thus enabling secure listing of orders. If customers were provided with their own accounts, orders can be further segregated under `/users/{userId}/orders/{orderId}` where the access is restricted to the user and admins only.\n\n**Invariants:** The structure supports data integrity with regards to timestamps by using the `createdAt` field. Ownership is enforced through structural patterns and security rules."
